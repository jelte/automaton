Introduction
------------

PHP Automoton wsa developed as a stand-alone tool to be included in the composer configuration of your projects.
The main reason for this is that deploy tools evolve and configuration formats change and we wanted a tool that we could keep in sync.

Requirements
------------

PHP Automoton is developed for 5.4 and up, no support is offered for earlier version.

Documentation
